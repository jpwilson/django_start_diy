# Cookie-cutter
This is my cookie - cutter for new web apps. 
I made this when doing mvp for [Our Family Socials](https://github.com/jpwilson/OurFamilySocials)

### Point of this is that, when starting a new project, I already have: 
- custom user model
- login / logout (django allauth and django auth) setup 
- docker setup (yml & dockerfile) 
- postgres db on docker img also setup and connect 

### How to use:
- Fork and start coding
